Subject: Join Biddt — Building the Future of Safe Local Commerce

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because we're building something exciting at Biddt, and your background in [specific area] caught my attention.

**What we're building:**
Biddt is a mobile marketplace that combines the excitement of auctions with the safety of escrow payments. Think "eBay meets Venmo meets verified local meetups." Users bid on items, pay into escrow, then verify the exchange in person with a QR code. No cash, no scams, no shows.

**The problem:**
Facebook Marketplace has 43% scam rates. People carry cash to meet strangers. Sellers deal with lowball offers and no-shows. There's no trusted platform for local high-value transactions.

**Our solution:**
- Escrow payments (buyer pays before meeting, seller gets paid after verification)
- Auction format (gamified, fair price discovery)
- QR verification (digital handshake unlocks funds)

**Where we are:**
- 34 screens designed (Nike-inspired UX)
- Business plan complete
- $500K seed round
- Launching in Halifax in 12 weeks

**The role: [Position]**
[Customize based on role - see below]

**Why join now:**
- Early equity (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
- Build the team and culture your way
- Strong design foundation, clear roadmap
- Meaningful problem — safety in commerce

I'd love to tell you more. Are you free for a 20-minute call this week?

Best,
[Your name]
Founder, Biddt
