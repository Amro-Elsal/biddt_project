[Logo placeholder]

---

### Slide 2: The Problem

**Local Commerce is Broken**

**For Buyers:**
- Facebook Marketplace: 43% report scams or no-shows
- Carrying cash to meet strangers is risky
- No protection if item is fake/damaged

**For Sellers:**
- Lowball offers, tire kickers, ghosting
- No-shows waste time
- Cash handling risks

**The Trust Gap:**
Current solutions force users to choose between convenience (risky) and safety (complicated).

---

### Slide 3: The Solution

**Biddt: Safety First, Price Best**

Three innovations:

1. **Escrow Payments**
   - Buyer pays before meeting
   - Money held safely until verification
   - Seller gets paid instantly after QR scan

2. **Gamified Bidding**
   - Auction format creates price discovery
   - Excitement drives engagement
   - Sellers get fair market value

3. **QR Verification**
   - Digital handshake unlocks funds
   - Proof of successful exchange
   - Dispute resolution built-in

---

### Slide 4: How It Works
