# Biddt Logo & Brand Identity

## Concept: "Winning the Treasure"

### Core Idea
The Biddt logo captures the moment of triumph — winning a bid, discovering treasure, the diamond in the rough. It combines:
- **The Diamond** — Value, rarity, premium quality
- **The Crowd** — Community, competition, marketplace
- **The Win** — Success, celebration, achievement
